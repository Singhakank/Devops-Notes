OSI Model Layer = Introduced by ISO, which will enable programs to exchange the data over the network independent of platforms on which the programs are running.
It has been divided into 7 layers
1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Network Layer
6. Datalink Layer
7. Physical Layer

#1 Application Layer = here it defined Application protocol, helping the application standardized the message structure and semantics over which the application has to exchange the data in understandable format.
Each application can define their own standards overwhich it want client programs to communicate, so they can be many application protocols specific to application.
  
The Internet standard has identified certain applications which are commonly used as part of daily life and standardized protocols for each type of application enabling vendor/platform interoperability.

Web, HTML           = HTTP (80)
File Transfer       = FTP  (20/21)
Exchange Email
                    = SMTP (25)
                    = POP3 (110)
                    = IMAP (143)
Remote Desktop app  = RDP (3389)  
Secure Shell        = SSH (22)

No 2 computers can exchange the data, we need applications to perform operations. For most common activities there are applications build on standard protocols.
  If our application works based on HTTP protocol in serving web pages: HTTP Server and HTPP Client prog
                                    FTP protocol in uploading/downloading files: FTP Server and Client prog
                                    SMTP,POP3,IMAP, for email exchange: Exchange Server and Mail Client prog
                                    
How does the client should access the server program?                                    
The client always has to build URL in order to access the server program which comprises of the below
schema://host:port/resource
http://localhost:8081/application

#2 Presentation Layer [REFER: 10-AUG-2021-PRESENTATION-LAYER IMAGE]
Application Layer is responsible for structuring/preparing the data based on messaging standards agreed by both the application, but the data is not in a transmittable format.
Here comes Presentation Layer, it is responsible for presenting the data to lower-level layers allowing it to be transmittable. There are 3 responsibilies carried by Presentation Layer.
  2.1 Data Conversion
  2.2 Compression/De-Compression
  2.3 Encryption/DeCryption
  
#3 Session Layer
End to End application communication will be taken care by Session Layer, it performs 2 responsibilities
1. Authentication and Authorization
2. Session Management
