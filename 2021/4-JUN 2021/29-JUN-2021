How to process the contents of a text file using Linux commands?
There are linux commands that helps us in processing the contents of a text file like 
1. extracting the data from the file
2. reading specific fields
3. joining 2 files together
4. replace a specific data with another etc
all of these operations are considered processing the text content 

Linux has provided 4 text processing commands
1. cut
2. paste
3. awk
4. sed


#1 cut
cut is a command that takes text content as an input either  from a File or from STDIN and breaks the data into columns/fields based on the delimeter and prints the data onto the Console STDOUT.
  
accounts.txt
01982939,Martin,savings,1000
93838393,James,savings,2019
93837921,Bob,current,2733
  
syntax:-
cut -d "delimeter" -f fieldNo fileName [FILE INPUT]
cat filename | cut -d "delimeter" -f fieldNo [STDOUT as INPUT]
-d stands for delimeter = only single character
-f stands for field fieldNo

#2 paste
paste is used for merging contents of 2 different files line by lined, based on delimeter supplied.

products.txt
1,lg 32inch led tv,12000
2,samsung refrigerator,23000
3,bose headset,18000
  
product_inventory.txt
1,10
2,22
3,5
  
cat products.txt = it shows product data
cat product_inventory.txt = it shows product no and available stock

paste -d "," products.txt product_inventory.txt

1,lg 32inch led tv,12000,1,10
2,samsung refrigerator,23000,2,22
3,bose headset,18000,3,5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
awk
awk is used for performing operations on the text content like
1. scan file line by line
2. split each line into fields
3. extract contents based on pattern matching
4. we can perform operations on the data that matches the content
5. tranform data
6. format the data output
the difference between awk and cut is cut takes single character as a delimeter, where as awk accepts pattern based on which it extracts the data.
