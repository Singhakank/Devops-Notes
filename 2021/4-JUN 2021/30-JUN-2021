What are the text processing commands available in Linux?
There are 4 shell utilities available in Linux for text processing.
  1. cut
  2. paste
  3. awk
  4. sed
  
#1 cut
if we want to extract the data from a File based on a delimeter we can use cut command
syntax:-
cut -d "delimeter" -f fieldNo filename

for eg..
products.txt
1,lg 32 inch television,20000
2,samsung microwave, 12000
  
cut -d "," -f 1 products.txt
output:-
1
2

Note:- The delimeter can be a single character and doesnt support regular expressions.
  
#2 paste  
paste is used for merging the contents of 2 files line by line based on a delimeter supplied.
For eg.. we have 2 files as shown below.
  
products.txt
1,lg 32 inch television,20000
2,samsung microwave, 12000
  
stock.txt
1,109
2,23
  
Now we want to merge the contents of these 2 files using delimeter "," then we can apply paste as below.
paste -d "," products.txt stock.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 awk = is a utility that helps the programmers in processing the contents of the text file. We can perform the below operations on a text file using awk
  1. we can print all the lines of a text file
  2. we can search for content based on pattern and extract
  3. we can delimete the contents and print fields also individually
  4. we can apply actions on the matching content like print, transform etc
    
syntax:-    
awk options 'selectioncriteria {action}' inFile

For eg.. we supplied text file of 10 lines as an input to awk, how does it process.
  #1 it reads the contents of the text file line by line from top to the bottom
  #2 try to apply the selectioncriteria on each line and if matches takes that line
  #3 apply the action on that line
  
awk has predefined special variables to identify and process the text.
  1. NR = keeps the current record it is processing
  2. NF = no of fields of the current record
  3. FS = field separator by default the field separator in awk is "space"
  4. RS = record separator by default the record separator is new line
  5. OFS = Output Field Seperator by default the field separator while displaying the output is space
  6. ORS = while displaying the output default seperator for displaying records is new line.
    
employees.txt
1 mark 20000  permanent
2 steve 10200 contractor
3 bob 12999   permanent
    
#1 awk '{print}' employees.txt = equal to cat

#2 how to print the lines based on selection criteria
awk '/permanent/ {print}' employees.txt
now will display only the records that contains the text permanent

#3 by default awk delimetes the file contents based on space and holds in special variables of $1 - $n
$1 = employeeNo
$2 = name
$3 = salary
$4 = positionType
and for each line there is an another variable $0 holds complete content of the line
awk '{print}' employees.txt

want to transform the above file contents with delimeter as space to "," and write to a file with employee no and name, position

awk '{print $1","$2","$4}' employee.txt > emp-positions.txt

#4 we want to display only the lines between 2 and 4 only
awk 'NR==3, NR==4 {print $0}' employee.txt
awk 'NR>=3 && NR<=4 {print $2}' employee.txt
awk 'NR>=3 && /permanent/ {print $0}' employee.txt

#5 display only the records which are having 4 fields
awk 'NF==4 {print}' employee.txt

#6 how to change the default field separator from space to ",".
awk -F "," '{print $1}' products.txt

#7 print only the lines which contains number of characters are more than 15
awk 'length($0) >= 15 {print}' employee.txt
  
summarize:-
awk delimites the file by default with which character "space"  
how does it holds are represents the fields of data? with special variables $1 - $n 
want to access complete record $0
Current Line number = NR
No of fields in the record = NF
