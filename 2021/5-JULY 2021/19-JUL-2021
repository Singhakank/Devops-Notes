#2 FOR Loop
The FOR loop is also an Loop control statement only, it is also used for executing a block of code repeatedly at a certain place in our program. But it is a different way of achieving the same.
  
There are 2 forms of FOR loop are there
  1. FOR loop is majorly used for iterating over a fixed list of values without specifying couter, condition and incrementation in our loop
  2. we can equally specify couter, condition and incrementation but all at one place unlike while loop.

#1. Fixed list of values overwhich we want to iterate using FOR loop
syntax
