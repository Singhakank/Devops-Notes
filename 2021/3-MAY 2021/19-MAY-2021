Packing and Un-Packing files 
----------------------------
Usually we store the data on a File, and we can group multiple files together into a Folder to identify and access related files quickly.
  
File = can be transfered from one machine to the another machine, in multiple ways
  - over email we can exchange
  - over network we can transfer etc
Folder = group of files, cannot be transferable between computers or over an email as well.

How to make the Folder and filecontents inside it transferrable, that is where packaging comes into picture.
Packing = is technic of combining multiple files and folders into one single file. packing different from compression, here the file contents are not being reduced in size, we just combile multiple files/folders into one single to transfer them easily.
  
#30 files = want to send the 30 files over the network to another computer. so we need to transfer 30 files each one of it at a time by establishing connection and disconnection for 30 times, impacts the performance. instead of it we can package 30 files into 1 single file and transfer at one-shot.
  
similarly we can package one or more folder contents into one single file, so that it can be transferrable.
  
Linux has provided an utility called "tar" standards for tape archive, used for packing and unpacking the contents of files/folders together.
  
pack = tar -cvf filename.tar sourcefolder/files
here "hypen" (-) is used for passing options to the tar command, telling what operation should be done.

c = create the archive
v = verbose, display which files you are including in the tar
f = filename 
sourcefolder (or) files = list of folders and files to be packaged into the tar.

The tar command will produce one singlefile by packing all the input files/folder provided with an extension ".tar"
