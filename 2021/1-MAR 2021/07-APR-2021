#1 development environment ready
by using modern tools and technologies like
  - virtualization technology
  - iac tools (infrastructure automation tool)
  - software configuration management tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 choose a process model
  - use preferrably agile methodologies (scrum)
Why scrum?
helps you in identifying the failure at early stages and can build product/project in increments (sprints) and can be delivered to the owner

We have more aggresive development and delivery cycles, where a team has to encourage themselve in committing for the tasks to be development and delivered in short-intervals of time. To meet the delivery deadlines with short-intervals of time it is not possible to meet unless we use modern tools and technologies that is where devops compliments scrum methodology

In another way we can say = devops is the way through which we can implement agile methodologies.

How to do collaborative application development?
Use software configuration management tools (scm tools). There are lot of scm tools are available in the market like
  - wincvs
  - vss
  - perforce
  - svn
  - git
git is the recommended repository management software for implementing scrum/devops process
