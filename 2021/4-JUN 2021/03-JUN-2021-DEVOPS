In Linux we can give permissions for accessing the File/Folder of user as below.
#1 We can manage and assign permissions to 3 groups of users
  - owner = owner refers to the user who has created that file
  - group = the group to which that file belongs to, to those group of users we are assigning permission to access
  - others = who are not within user/group of File/Folder
  
#2 How many types of permissions are there?
  There are 3 types of permissions we can in Linux
  1. Read     = r
  2. Write    = w
  3. Excecute = x
The above permissions can be given to all 3 groups of users.
  
What is the meaning of above permissions for a ?
  File:
    Read = we can see the contents of the File
    Write = we can modify the contents of the File
    Execute = If given a program user can run it
  Folder:
    Read: we can list the files/folders inside it using (ls)
    Write: We can add/remove/copy/move a file or folder into it
    Execute: we can cd into that folder

By default a user dont need to specify the permissions with which a File/Folder should be created, Linux will derive default permissions based on a variable umask.

Can we change the default permissions of a File/Folder in Linux?
Yes, we can by using chmod shell utitlity.
      
chmod = stands for change the mode of access, is used for changing the permission for a File/Folder after creating. chmod allows us to modify the permissions in 2 ways.
  1. octal notation
  2. symbolic notation
  
#1 octal notation
For each permissions the chmod has given weighted number as shown below.
  READ    =   4
  WRITE   =   2
  EXECUTE =   1
             --- 
              7=max permission should be applied to owner,group,others
total numbers are 0 - 7 = 8 (octal)              
based on permission we want to grant we need to compute the total weighted value of the permissions and pass to chmod for all the groups of users.
  
Important points to keep in mind while using chmod:-  
1. always reset the permissions replacing the existing permissions.
2. we always has to pass permissions to all the 3 groups of users while changing.  
  
syntax:-
  chmod owner group other filename
  chmod 7     6     4     filename => chmod 764 filename
  

u: joe, pg: devops
memories.txt [rw-r--r--] (owner: joe, group: devops)  

  
pgGrouplevel:- u: bob, pg: devops => rw
groupLevel:-   u: mike, pg: mike, others: devops => rw
others:-       u: blake, pg: blake (he is not owner and not same group of file, so called others) => r



u: joe, g: devops
docs [rwxr-xr-x] (owner: joe, group: devops)
 |-meeting-notes.txt [rw-r--r--]  
 |-important.txt [rw-r--r--]
 
how to give write access to the group on folder docs/
chmod 775 docs/ = when we change permissions for a directory it only changes the permission of directory not the files inside the directory.
  
output:-
u: joe, g: devops
docs [rwxrwxr-x] (owner: joe, group: devops)
 |-meeting-notes.txt [rw-r--r--]  
 |-important.txt [rw-r--r--]

How to change permissions along with folder, even the subdirectories and files inside it?
chmod -R 774 docs/
-R indicates recursively apply these permissions to docs also and subdirectories and files inside it.
