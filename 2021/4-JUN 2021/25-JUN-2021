Bash Profiles
--------------
The bash profiles are bunch of configuration files in which user can configure settings using which he wanted to launch the shell/bash
#1 /etc/profile = global and can be modified by root only
#2 ~/.bash_profile = interactive login shell (if the file was not there we can create if we want)
#3 ~/.profile and ~/.bash_login = interactive login shell would be skipped in the presence of ~/.bash_profile
#4 ~/.bashrc = interactive non-login shell

What are symbolic links, how do we use them?
Symbolic links are the pointer to the original files of the linux filesystem. These are similar to the short-cut we create in windows operating system.
  
purpose:- to quickly access a file/folder on the linux filesystem we can use symlinks.
  
There are 2 types of symlinks are there
1. Softlink
2. Hardlink

How to create symbolic link?
linux has provided an utility ln (link), using which we can create a link file

softlink
---------
ln -s sourcefile linkfile
to identify the file type we can use
ls -l = shows the symbolic link file with (l) -> pointing to original file path
file filename


hardlink
---------
ln sourcefile linkfile
without -s by default it creates hardlink
