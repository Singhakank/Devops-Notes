How many layers are there in OSI Layer model?
There are 7 layers are there
1. Application Layer:- Message Sematics and Structure to allow applications to exchange the data in understandable format
2. Presentation Layer:- 3 Responsiblities
  2.1 Data Conversion
  2.2 Data Compression/DeCompression
  2.3 Data Encryption/DeCryption
3. Session Layer  = End-End communication between the applications are managed by Session Layer
  3.1 Authentication/Authorization = Keeps track of the authentication/authorization role of the user information of the users accessing.
  3.2 Session Management
      - keeps track of the data like how many data packets has been transmitted, still how many are pending
      - which data packets belongs to which application at receiver side
      - reconstructing the original message based on sequence order
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Transport Layer = It performs 3 responsibilities
  4.1 Segmentation = takes the data from Presentation Layer, breaks them into smaller packets and assigns port no of the receiver program and sequence no to assemble the message in the proper order 
  The process of breaking the data into packets by assigining port and sequence no is called "Segmentation"  
  4.2 Flow Control = Instructs the sender to slow down the data transfer rates when the reciever is slow network connection receiver to avoid lost of data 
  4.3 Error Control = computes and adds checksum bits to the data segment, allowing the receiver to detect the faulty or lost data segments and instructs the sender to resend
  
5. Network Layer = Takes care of transmitting the data from a computer to another network
  5.1 Logical Addressing
  5.2 Routing
  5.3 Path Determination
