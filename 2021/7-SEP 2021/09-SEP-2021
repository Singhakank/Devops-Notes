#1. Not Attached
The virtul machine has network adapter, but the network cable has not been plugged in connecting to the network. Generally we use this network mode to simulate network disconnection, so that we can test our software application behaviour while the network got disconnected.

#2. NAT (Network Address Translation)
The virtualbox will attach the network interface card by default to an virtual machine with NAT network mode.
