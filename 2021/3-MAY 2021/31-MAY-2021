There are 2 types of users are there
1. Root user = full access to the linux machine
2. Normal user = only has access to the home directory location and can run his own process.
  
We can promote a normal user as a previliged user by making him as sudoer. A sudoer is almost equal to an delegated Root user given the type of permissions provided by the Root user to the sudoer.
  
How to promote/nominate a user as a Sudoer?
There are 2 ways are there
  1. make an entry in /etc/sudoers file
    There are 2 levels at which we can promote a user as a sudoer
    1.1 user level
      For each user we want to promote as a sudoer add an entry for the user as below
      username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL = This grants full access to the linux machine
      
      if we want to allow user to execute specific commands on a user we need to use Cmnd_Alias as described below.
      Cmnd_Alias FILE_CMNDS=/bin/ls, /bin/touch
      username ALL=(ALL) FILE_CMNDS
      
    1.2 group level
      Instead of providing access to individual user we can promote a group of users as sudoers. a group definition in sudoers file should begin with %groupName
      %groupName ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
          
  2. add the user to the sudoer group
    instead of the above we can simply add a user to the sudoers group. "sudoers" is a pre-defined group available in ubuntu install and configured in sudoers file for all permissions.
      
lets say we promoted joe as a sudoer, as below.
/etc/sudoers
joe ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

sudo ls
sudo mkdir dairy 
by default any commands that are executed by the suoders using sudo will be ran onbehalf of Root user. if we want to run the commands onbehalf a different user we need to use su 

sudo su bob mkdir dairy = without the need of login/logout a user can execute the commands onbehalf of other users using "su".

File permissions
===================
Linux operating has been designed keeping in support of multiple users can access it at the same time. 
  
If all of the users has the access to the same physical resources of the computer machine, can one user can access a File/Folder that is created by the other user in Linux?
  
If Linux operating system allows any one to access any of the Files/Folders created by any other user, then there is no security and it indirectly means there is no use of having multiple users as all can access any of files/folders.
Instead create one user and give to everyone is sufficient.
From the above we can if it permits in such a way we cannot say Linux as an Multi-User Operating System.
  
To be truely an Multi-User operating system Linux enforces permissions on the Files/Folders users creates not allowing other users to access it.
  
File Permissions:-
------------------
There are 3 levels of permissions are associated to a File/Folder in Linux
- owner (user)
- group
- others

we can find a file/folder belongs to which user and group by using 
ls -l  (be in directory of the file)
ls -l filename
