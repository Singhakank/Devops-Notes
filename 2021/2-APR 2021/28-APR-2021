Filepointer table
File blocks
Data blocks
-> how does files are stored and organized on a storage device of a computer.

What is a File?
File is a datastructure which holds the memory block address of where the actual data resides on our storage.
  
Where does the data will be stored on a storage device of a computer?
The storage memory is divided into 2 parts
1. data blocks = is the actual physical locations of the storage where our data is placed
2. Filesystem space = holds the File blocks and Filepointer table to locate and access the data from datablocks
  2.1 Fileblock = holds the metadata information of the data like Name, size, owner, created date etc
  2.2 FilePointer Table = table is a key,value datastructure in which filename and fileblock address will be stored. so that while accessing the data the operating system searches for the file in 
  Filepointer table to identify FileBlock and Datablocks for the File.  

The entire mechanism of storing and organizing the data is called "Fileystem" technic

Different operating systems comes up with different Filesystem mechanisms.
Windows operating system supports following Filesystem Technics
1. FAT
2. NTFS

Linus operating system supports different Filesystem Technics
supported:
1. EXT = old one and no longer used 
2. EXT2 = allows us to store 2 terrabytes of data. 
3. EXT3 = is an updated version of EXT2 and backward compatible with EXT2, doesnt support recovery
4. EXT4 = faster and allows large files with significant speed to be managed. default filesystem in linux. it supports recovery
5. JFS = very old filesystem developed by IBM. it supports both small and big files, but if failed or corrupted after long time use.  
6. XFS = is a very old filesystem and works slowly with small files
7. Btrfs = developed by oracle, it is not stable like EXT in some distros. it has good performance.
  
Linux Filesystem is hierarchial which represents or stores files in parent and child relationship.
Please refer to hierarchial-representation.jpg for more information on Hierarchial Structure.
  
In linux the Filesystem starts from one single root node called "/" (root) represents the root of the Filesystem. every other file/folder on the storage will exists under the root only. The linux operating has comeup with pre-defined directory structure layout to organize different types of files of the operating system.
  
What is the advantage of Linux Filesystem being hierarchial?
The user can easily navigate into a specific directory of the Filesystem to locate a group/type of related Files. For eg.. I want to access all the super user shell commands that are shipped as part of linux goto /sbin directoy you find there.

What are the standard directories that comes as part of the Linux Filesystem?
/
|-bin    = all the shell command files are there inside the bin directory.
|-boot   = boot loader files to boot linux operating system are in boot directory.  
|-dev    = dev stands for devices. all the physical devices like usb, cd, dvds are mounted onto /dev directory
|-etc    = Contains configuration files for the installed software pacakges
|-home   = For every user we create in linux a sub-directory will be created under /home with his name
|-lib    = library files of the installed software packages are placed here
|-media  = 
|-mnt
|-opt
|-proc
|-sbin
|-root
|-tmp
|-usr
|-var

When we install linux operating system on our computer the following directories are created by linux on our filesystem to organize the files of our system.
Mouting is the process of linking the ext devices on to the Filesystem so that those are made accessible.
