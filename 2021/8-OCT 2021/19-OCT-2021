What is jar application or an executable jar, why do we need it?
While distributing an java application to the enduser we build and deliver the application as an executable jar or java jar application.
  
In order to run the java program, we need to set the classpath to all the dependencies and we need to pass main classname as an input to jre to run the program. all such technical inputs related to our application in running the application is not known to the enduser.
  
Let the developer define such information in executing the applcation in manifest.mf and place in within META-INF/ directory of the jar file, So that JRE while executing the jar reads the information from manifest and executes without taking inputs from the user.
  
*.jar
|-META-INF
  |-manifest.mf
    Main-Class: fqnClassname
|-*.class
  
insurance
|-src
  |-PolicyManager.java
|-bin
  |-PolicyManager.class
manifest.txt    

package com.bajajallianz.service;
public class PolicyManager {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Policy Manager at your service!");
  }
}
  
#1. 
~/javaworkspace/insurance/>  javac -d bin src/PolicyManager.java

#2. write manifest.txt file with the contents you want to place in manifest.mf of jar
manifest.txt
Main-Class: com.bajajallianz.service.PolicyManager

#3. 
~/javaworkspace/insurance/>
jar -cvfm insurance.jar manifest.txt  -C bin/ .

What is an distributed web application, how do we build it in java programming language? 
Distributed web applications are the applications that are accessible over the network using http protocol and servers web content (html markup) over the network.  
  
The endusers uses client tools/programs like web browsers in accessing the web application and the webpages over the network by sending http request/http response.
  
There are 2 types of distributed web applications are there
1. static
as part of these applications only HTML markup pages will be there and no matter how many times we accessed the web pages, that content will fixed and rendered the same.
  
2. dynamic
These applications will take user data as an input, using the data they perform operations and produces the response to the user based on the inputs. which means the response from the application will change from user to user based on their inputs, so it is called dynamic web application

we need server-side programming languages to building dynamic web applications like
java
.net
ruby
scala
