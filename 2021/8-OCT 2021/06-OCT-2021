How to enable SSH access to an Machine?
  
Server Machine
#1. Install SSH Server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openssh-server

#2.
SSH Server during the install will create an ssh server settings configuration file under the path
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

#3 generate public and private keypair (workstation)
There are 2 ways
1. puttygen windows
2. ssh-keygen linux tool (generates the pub/private key under ~/.ssh with names id_rsa.pub and id_rsa.ppk)

place both pub/ppk file under user home directory or its sub directories only incase of windows (due to security restrictions)
In case of Linux machine you can place the keys anywhere (still recommended userhome directory only), but the permissions for keys should be 600
  
#4 copy the public key onto the SSH Server into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
for the user whom we want to enable ssh access
There are 2 ways in copying the keys
1. scp command
2. ssh-copy-id

#5 disable passwordAuthentication in sshd_config file
#6 ssh to the machine
There are 2 ways
putty:-
ssh client:-
ssh user@ipaddress
ssh -p port user@ipaddress
ssh -p port -i location public keyfile user@ipaddress
