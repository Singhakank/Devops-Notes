DevOps = A change in culture and adoption of new tools and process in building and delivery software applications quickly to the world.

Software Application = a set programs written by group of deveopers in meeting the end-user/business requirements of a system. 

Business owner | Organization
===================================
The business owner or business organization has to provide requirements for developing the software. These requirements are provied in documents called Business Requirement Documents (BRD)

Developers:-
So developers/programmers will build the software systems based on the requirement of the business. These people use programming languages in building the software applications.
 - c
 - c++
 - java
 - .net
 - python
 - php
 - scala
 - ruby
They will write the code/instructions in running the program using those languages.

Once developed these applications cannot be delivered to the customers/business owners/enterprise, because the code|program|software they build may not work properly.

Quality Assurance 
==================
Engineer (Team) = He understands the business requirements clearly that is provided by business owner | organization and verifies|validates the software system build by the developers and certify.

Operational Engineers = He understands the system software that is build by developers and facilitates necessary infrastructure (computer machines | network cables | physical resources). System software to be installed to run the application.
Then finally he takes the delivered application and runs on the Final environment so that the software will be available to the public usage

What are the roles of people involved in development and delivery of a software application?
1. developer
2. quality assurance engineer
3. operational engineer

What are the stages of development and delivery of the software
1. develop
2. test
3. deliver

This is called the Software developer and delivery process that takes place in a software manufacturing process.
