How to compare contents of 2 different files in Linux?
There are 2 ways we can do file comparision using Linux shell commands
  1. cmp
  2. diff

#1. cmp = is a shell command used for comparing the contents of 2 files byte by byte and produces the first difference of the file as an output.
basket1.txt
apple
oranges
papaya

basket2.txt
apple
banana
annar

cmp basket1.txt basket2.txt
cmp basket1.txt basket2.txt: byte 7, line2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
diff = diff is used for comparing 2 text files and displays all the mis-matches in the files. it has few features as below
  1. in addition to comparision, it will display special symbols helping us to understand what should be done to make those 2 files identical.
  a = add
  c = change the text of the file
  d = delete line
  
  2. along with that it indicates how can we make these files identical from which side file to otherside we need apply above operations
  > = indicates the right side of the file
  < = indicates suggestion give above should be applied to the left side file
  2,5c3 < = in the left file from 2-5 lines change or replace with line 3 of the right side file
  

it compares the 2 files and shows all the differences
suggestions, how to make these 2 files identical (same)
  
basket1.txt
apple
banana
grapes

basket2.txt
apples
papaya
grapes

diff basket1.txt basket2.txt

1,2c1,2
line 1 - 2 changed with line 1 - 2
<apple
<banana
--------
>apples
>papaya

Pipes and Redirections

Pipes (|) = it is used for joining or chaining the shell command output. The output of one command can be redirected as input into another command with which 2nd command will executes. 
  
(or)
2 or more commands can be joined together in passing the output of 1st command as an input to the 2nd command to execute them together.

wc = word count = we can count the number of words, characters and lines of a give file using word count command.
  
wc -l = lines 
wc -w = word (spaces will be counted for identifying the words)
wc -c = character
wc -lw = lines and words
wc -lc = lines and characters
ws -cw = characters and words

If you pass any text content/string as an input it will display the above things.

echo "How are you" = echo will output to the terminal, but now we want to pass it as an input to another command to count number of words inside the text content

echo "How are you" | wc - w

players.txt
dhoni
vihrat
kohli
rohit

cat players.txt | wc -l

who = displays the number of uses currently logged into your linx machine
We want to know how many number of users are currently logged into the machine?
who | wc -l

To add an user into linux system we need to use adduser command
sudo adduser [USERNAME]
sudo adduser bob


How to see the number of users who has accounts in the linux operating system?
Linux will store all the users of the operating in a configuration file under /etc directory called "passwd". and for each user 1 line will written into that file.
cat /etc/passwd = we can see the users of linux operating system

so to get number of user accounts
cat /etc/passwd | wc -l

How to know the number of files/directories that are there in the current working directory?
ls -l | wc -l
