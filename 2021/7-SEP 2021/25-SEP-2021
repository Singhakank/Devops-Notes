What is an web application? what is the purpose of it?
Web Application is meant for distributing or sharing the information to the world. We build webpages and distribute over the internet on HTTP protocol.
  
How to build web pages?
In order to write web pages with information in readable format, we need to use HTML language. 
HTML stands for Hypertext markup language, introduced by w3c organization. HTML language contains bunch of pre-defined tags using which we can format the content and render it to the enduser.
Every HTML page is defined with standard tags and fixed structure.
  
<!DOCTYPE html> = it is an HTML 5 document
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <b>This</b> is an HTML Page.
  </body>
</html>

Now enduser will access the HTML Page (or) WebPage using a client software called brower. HTML browser will parse the tags and display the information in a formatter manner

An web application can be classified into 2 types
1. static web application
The static web application contains only HTML pages, which will always renders the same content/information to all the users whoever are accessing. Usually in a static web application we have only
1. HTML pages
2. images
3. stylesheet = decorating the contents of the page
  
2. dynamic web application
These are the application which takes the user input performs operation and provides a dynamic response depends on the user inputs to the enduser. To build an dynamic webapplication we need to use a server-side programming language like
1. java
2. .net
3. python
4. cgi
5. perl
etc
