CIDR Notation
CIDR Stands for Class-less inter-domain routing. with a ip classification there is no flexibility of allocating network and host bits based on our requirement, due to fixed allocation schema few bits are being left as unused.
  
To overcome the problem CIDR notation has been introduced. While working with CIDR notation the ip address is always represented with ip/networkbits pattern as shown below.
  
192.168.45.32/22 = here the notation indicates how many bits are allocated to network address. Now we need derive the network address and host address by computing the Subnet mask.
