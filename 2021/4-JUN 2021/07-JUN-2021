How to find the user shell in which we are running the commands?
whoami

How to find the user with which we loggedin?
logname

How many users are loggedin to the Linux?
users
who = it shows the details of login timestamp

How to know the operating system name?
uname
uname -a = prints all the details

How to find the hostname of the computer?
hostname = prints the computer/machine name
hostname -i = loopback ip address
hostname -I = prints all the ip addresses associated with that computer.
  
How to change the hostname of the computer?
go and modify the hostname within the /etc/hostname

How to find the network interfaces and their ip address within the Machine?
ifconfig = is not available by default we need to install net-tools package
  
sudo apt install -y net-tools
ifconfig = shows all the network interfaces attached to the computer along with their network address

How to verify the reachability of a server?
ping serverName/ip address


How to list down the hardware devices attached to our machine?
lshw = the output differs between root/normal user

What are the init levels in linux? (RunLevels)
These are even called as RunLevels.
  
init 0 = shutdown
init 1 = Single user mode or emergency mode means no network, no multitasking is only root has access
init 2 = No network, but multitasking support is present
init 3 = network is present, multitasking is present but no GUI
init 4 = it is similar to init 3 only, for reserved for research
init 5 = network is present mult-tasking and GUI is present with Sound
init 6 = System restart


reboot = restart
reboot -f = fast restart

sudo mkdir storage
sudo -u joe mkdir /home/joe/storage

By default when we run a program in linux, it can access all the files/folders of the Filesystem, that user has access. So from this we can understand if the user is a Root/Sudoer the program can gain access to the Files/Folders of linux by running as sudoer.
From the above we can understand we could run into a big security problem in linux where a program can open/up or do anything on the files/folders of the computer given it has been launched as sudoer or a user has all the access to the computer.
  
How to address the above problem?
Lets say we want to run tomcat server. Then create a user called tomcat in linux, dont give sudoer permission, give permission to a directory
tomcat user -> /u01/app/tomcat = place your software in tomcat directory and run it.
  
In linux we create users for 2 reasons.
  1. we want to grant access to the linux system for other users
  2. we want to isolate the execution of programs in the linux operating system by running it under a user with less priveliges and permissions

What is a Program?
Program is a File on the Filesystem. In case of a Program File it contains executable instructions rather than data, so that we execute the program instructions inside it by passing to our operating system.
