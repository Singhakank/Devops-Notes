Linux is an Multi-User Operating System, by default when a user creates an File/Folder the other users of the Linux will not be able to access. If anyone can access another other users File/Folders then there is no need of Multiple Users in Linux. 
We can create one user and can give the credentials to all.
  
When linux permits multiple users to use a machine its responsibility to ensure it provide security in allowing the users to access the Files/Folders of others. For this Linux has comeup with File Permissions.
  
We can apply File permissions on 3 levels of users in linux.
  1. owner
  2. group
  3. others

How many types of permissions we can grant for a File?
  1. read = r
  2. write = w
  3. execute = x
  
We can give 3 permissions for 3 levels of users.
owner group others
rwx   rwx   rwx

When a user has created a file/folder the File/Folder will be associated to that user a owner and the primary group of the user as File/Folder group.
Now the owner can give File/Folder permissions to the owner, group and others.
by default for a File with what permissions will be created?
  rw-rw-r-- = file
default permissions for a folder?
  rwxrwxr-x = folder

When a user is creating an File/Folder in linux, user dont need to specify the permissions. linux will assign default permissions for a File/Folder while creating by taking from umask value.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

joe@sriman$ touch products
with the above command "products" file will be created with default file permissions as rw-rw-r-- which indicates
owner = read/write
group = read/write
others= read

Can we change the default permissions associated with a File/Folder, when we need different?
We can change the default permissions of a File/Folder using chmod command

chmod = its a linux shell command, stands for change mode of access. using this command we can change the access mode of a File or Folder in linux
the owner of the file/folder can change = by default owner is allowed to change
apart from owners = sudoers are allowed.

chmod supports 2 notations of working with chaning the File/Folder permissions.
  1. octal notation
    For each file permission a weighted number has been given indicating that permission.
    READ    =  r  =  4
    WRITE   =  w  =  2
    EXECUTE =  x  =  1
  ------------------------------
                     (0-7) = (8)
  -------------------------------
  owner group others
  5     4     4
  7     6     4
  7     4     0
  we need to give 3 column value indicating 1st = owner 2 place = group 3rd place = others
  joe@sriman$ touch products
  rw-rw-r--
  664
  
  syntax:
  -----------
  chmod 764 products
  chmod 777 products
  
  always 3 column numbers are mandatory, even we want to change permissions for a group also
  
  chmod 764 products = here we want to issue owner = execute permission but group,others we want default permission, even then also we need to pass permissions for group/others while chaning
    
  2. symbolic notation
  
  

users/groups:-
joe, bob = pg: devops 
blake = pg: blake, othergroups: devops

mike = pg: mike
