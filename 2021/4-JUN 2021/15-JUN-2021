Each operating system or platform provides their own 

  - packaging format in distributing the software application
  - package manager / installer tools for install the software packages
  
Why does different operating systems has comeup with different packages standards and package manager tools?
===============================================================================================================
A software application distributed by the programmer/developer will works on only specific platform/operating system only, since it is compiled to that operating system.
 
Now the developer has to package that compiled application in order to distribute on to that platform. 
    
So how does an enduser can distinguish the packaged application provided by the developer will works on which platform since it is compiled to that platform?
So to help the enduser in identifying that software runs on which platform every operating system has defined their own packaging standards and tools associated to that packaging standard.

There are different distributions of linux operating system. each of the distro has provided different package formats and package manager tools why?
=========================================================================================================================================
even though the software application compiled to linux and distributed by the developer works across all the linux distros (because kernal / system routines are same), still we have different packaging formats because.
    - kernal has not provided any package standard to distribute the software application and no installer is available
  
because of these running a sofware application on linux becomes difficult, because enduser should know how to run the software application.
    
To overcome this problem every linux distro has comeup with their own packaging standard and package manager tools which resulted in different package standards and managers.
      debain distribution
      .deb = packaging standard
      dpkg = package manager tool
    
    redhat distribution
      .rpm = packaging standard
      rpm = package manager tool
