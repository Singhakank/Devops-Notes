What is a process?
Program under execution is called a "Process", process is a way through which operating system will keeps track of the programs which are under execution.
  
How to see the process that are running on the Linux?
top = table of process
USER  PID  PR  NICE  S  VIRMEM   SHRDMEM   RESMEM  CPU   TIME + COMMAND

A process can be in any of the below states
1. D = Daemon process
2. S  = Sleeping
3. R = Running
4. I = idle
5. T = traced / terminated
6. Z = zoombie

What is priority of a process?
based on the priority of a process, the linux operating system is going allocate the cpu for that process. There are 2 types of process are there
1. System process
These are lauched during the linux bootup and are created by the linux operating system to run necessary services.
  network service
  firewall service
  systemd service
    
2. User Process
These process are created the linux operating system when a user submits a program for execution.
  
The priority of a process can be anywhere between 0 - 139, out of which a system process space = 0 -99 and a user process priority space = 100 - 139
  
Linux user will not be allowed/cannot modify the priority of a process directly, which might result in a negative effect of crashing the system.
  
Linux user can modify the priority of a process in a controller way through NICE value.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
What is NICE value, what is the purpose of it?
through NICE value a user can change the priority of a process.
NICE value can range between = -20 = to = 19. and based on the nice value the PR (priority) of a process is computed by linux as below.
  PR = 20 + NICE_VALUE
  
The lowest the NICE value means more priority, the highest the NICE has less priority process.
Can we change the NICE value of a process?
Yes we can increase a NICE but to decrease NICE value you have to be an sudoer.
  
There are 2 ways we assign the nice value
#1 while launching the program itself we can specify the nice value
nice -n number command/program

#2 if there exists already a program running we need take the pid and renice it
renice -n number pid

How to see the process that are running on the linux?  
top = is a live command which will running and more used for monitoring the process.
  
To find process status within a give interval of time, as of now what process are running, want to know the list of them go for ps.  
ps = process status
ps -au = -a stands for all the process of all the TTY, -u = username
ps -x = only current running process of the user
ps -ef = -e = everyones or all the user process and BSD Format
ps -eo pid,ppid,ni,command = -e = everone process / -o stands for display these columns only as an output

How to kill a linux process?
#1 we need to find the pid of the process either through top or ps (recommended)
  
kill pid
kill -9 pid (dont wait for the process terminate forcefully)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many types of process are there in Linux?
There are 2 types of process are there
  1. foreground process
  2. background process

#1 foreground process
These are the process that will be attached tty (terminal) during execution and will unblock the terminal only after its completion to let the user interact with the program.
When do we use foreground process?
In general if there is a program, that requires user input during its execution then such process should be lauched as foreground process, so that process can collect the data from the user.
  
cal.sh
#!/bin/bash
read -p "a : " A
read -p "b : " B
SUM=$[A+B]
echo "SUM : $SUM"
  
above program requires A and B value as input, to ensure the program can talk to the user in collecting the data we need to lauch the process as foreground.
by default every process we launch on TTY are foreground process only.
  
#2 background process
