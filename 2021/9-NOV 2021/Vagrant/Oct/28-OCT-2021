When we are working on solutions based on client/server architecture we can manage to develop and deliver these applications more easily through vagrant.
Let us try to explore how does vagarnt helps in developing and delivering client-server architecture based application easily.
  
The developer in order to develop the client-server technology applications he need 2 environments.
  1 server environment = we need to setup web server (optionally a database server) and other tools required for deploying and running the application. So that developer can test his code after completing the code.  
  2. client environment = Developer inorder to test the application requires client tools like web browser and other testing tools for testing the application
