File Management Commands
1. how to create an empty file? = touch filename
2. how know the current directory? = pwd
3. how to print a message to the Terminal/STDOUT? = echo "message"
4. how to see the contents of a File? = cat filename
5. How to create a file with data? = echo "contents" > filename (may or may not exists) >> (append)
6. How to list the directory contents? = ls
    - long listing directory contents = ls -l
    - human readable format = ls -lh
    - recursively see all the sub-directory contents = ls -R

by default when we open the Terminal we will be in $USER directory

directory related commands
_-_-_-__-__-__-__-__-__-__-__-_

#1 create directory commands
How to create a directory to place the group of related files? (folder)
mkdir = stands for make directory
syntax:-
mkdir directoryName

/home/sriman$ mkdir dir1/dir2 = Yes given if dir1 already exists then dir2 will be created inside dir1, otherwise gives error

if we want to create all the directories along with the path specified we can use below command
mkdir -p dir1/dir2 = even dir1 doesnt exists it creates first and then creates child directory
-p = stands for path

#2 change directory commands
_-_-_-__-__-__-__-__-__-__-__-_
we can switch or change into the directory using cd
cd = stands for change directory
cd books = now you will be inside the books directory and all the command we execute here will works relative to books directory only.
  
cd .. = will takes you to the parent directory (cd space ..)
cd (or) cd ~ = both will takes the user to his home directory
cd - = takes you to the previous directory where you came from
cd directoryName = takes you into that directory
cd dir1/dir2/dir3 = takes you directly into the dir3 (nested directories)
  

#3 how to remove/delete directory?
rm fileName = removes the given file
rmdir directoryName = to delete the directory given it is empty. if the directory has contents inside it (files/folders), then the command gives error asking us to empty the directory before deleting.

if we want to delete the directory complete including the files inside it at one-shot we can use the below command

rm -r directoryName = -r stands for recursively delete all of the sub-directories and files inside the directory

in addition we can use -f flag = stands force if we have any special files inside the directory to delete.
rm -rf directoryName  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a shell utility called Tree, we can use it for seeing the structure of the directory contents in tree format.
by default tree utility will not be available in ubuntu distro, we need to install it explicitly, using apt (package manager)
  
to install tree utility we need to run the below command
sudo apt install tree = this will install the tree shell utility (program)

tree = displays the current directory structure as tree
tree directoryName = displays that directory contents in tree structure.
tree -L n directoryName = -L stands for level, how many levels of subdirectories to be shown we can control.
  
tree is a very handy/useful utitlity while we are working on projects to see directory structure of our project, and mostly used.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In windows a file is always created with an extension of (.3characters)
For eg..
notes.txt (text file)
syllabus.pdf (pdf)
accounts.xls (excelsheet)
The extension helps the windows to identify the type of the file, so that it can associate a relevant action to that file.
  
For eg.. when we click on .pdf extension files, windows opens acrobat reader. if we double click on a .exe file windows runs the program. So, extension plays a crucial role in identify the type of the file in windows.
  
In Linux File extensions are not mandatory/required. Linux to identify the type of the file it always tries to see the contents of the file to determine. linux being intelligent enough can determine what a file is of type by its own.
  
But how about an user of Linux knows by looking at a file what is its type is?
For eg..
accounts
logo
what is the type of accounts or logo by looking at the filename, we cannot identify so we dont know what to do with those files.
To help us in identifying the file types linux as provided an command called file.
  
file filename = tells the type of the file.
