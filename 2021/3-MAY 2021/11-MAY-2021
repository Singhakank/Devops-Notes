In general the shell commands takes the input from STDIN and writes the output to STDOUT, if want to redirect the input/output of the shell commands then we need to use redirection operators.
  There are 2 redirection operators are there
    1. < = input redirection
    2. > = output redirection

a command input can be redirected from a different source than STDIN by using input redirection.
cat < file1.txt
cat < file1 > file2.txt
cat < file1.txt - file2.txt >> file3.txt

find = if we want to search for files/folders on our filesystem based on names in linux, we can use find command

#1 
find directory/ -name "pattern" -print [by default print is enabled, prints each matching file in a separate line]

#2
find directory/ -name "pattern" -print0 [prints all the matching filenames in one single line]

#3
find directory/ -name "pattern" -empty = display all the empty files matching with the given name

#4 
find directory/ -name "pattern" -exec command {} \; = exec the command supplied on all the matching files

#5 
find directory/ -name "pattern" -o  -name "pattern" = either matching first pattern or second pattern will produced as output

#6 
find directory/ -name "pattern" -perm octal = search for files of the given pattern with permissions matching (later)
  For eg.. find directory/ -name "pattern" -perm 644 = shows only the list of files matching with permissions as rw-r-r only

find is used for searching for files/folder matching with the given "name/pattern" on the filesystem

grep (content search) = searching for a text inside file, search for the files, whose contents are matching the given text, this is really a powerful feature of linux, where no operating system really provides.
Most handy command used for searching in log files to find errors., so frequently asked question is how to search in log files can you explain?
  
#1 grep "text" filename = it displays all the matching lines of the text within that file.
  
#2 grep -R "text" directory = it displays all the matching lines of the text within all the files of the directory recursively

#3 grep -n "text" filename = it displays all the matching lines of the text within that file, along with line number

#4 grep by default is case-sensitive, the text supplied will be searched with matching case only.
  notes1.txt "Good times"
  grep "good" notes1.txt = will not give output (no matching lines)
  grep -i "good" notes1.txt  = here -i stands for ignore case
