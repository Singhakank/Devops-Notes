#1 search for a phrase or text in an given input file
grep "text" filename

#2 search for directories and subdirectories to find the input phrase
grep -R "text" directory\

#3 find the lines where the whole word is matching and print those lines
grep -w "phrase" filename

#4 output only the matching words rather than lines
grep -o "phrase" filename

#5 ignore case while matching the phrase
grep -i "phrase" filename

#6 give me the lines which are not matching with input phrase
grep -v "phrase" filename

#7 get me the count of matching phrase in the given file
grep -c "phrase" filename

#8 print the line numbers where phrase was found, along with lines in output
grep -n "phrase" filename

In grep along with text/phrase matches in place of it we can use regular expressions also for matching phrase with file contents

[] = any one of the characters
[l-u] = matches any one of the range characters
^ = this pattern must appear at the begining of the line
$ = this pattern must appear at the end of each line
. = matches any one character
\ = escape character
* = zero or more occurrences 
.* = nothing or any number of characters

story.txt
Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself, he shouted, Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf! The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces.

grep "boy" story.txt = print all the lines where if the word contains boy
grep "b*" story.txt = print all the lines if the word contains b
