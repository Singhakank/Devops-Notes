What are Arrays? why do we need to use them?
arrays:- arrays are variables in which we store similar type of values.
why?:- we can apply the same logic to those group of values easily by looping through the values instead of duplicating the code referring different variables names

Problems without using arrays:-
without using arrays, if we want to store similar type of values and want to apply processing we run into several problems.
1. too many number of variable declarations makes you code difficult to understand
2. the code will be duplicated in referring different variables in apply same processing.
3. chances of referring variables wrongly in our program, which leads to bugs or errorneous output.
  
Now we want to install 5 software packages in our program, by keeping them in 5 variables we need to duplicate the code for installing 5 packages by writing 5 lines as shown below.  

#!/bin/bash
PKG1="net-tools"
PKG2="vim"
PKG3="tree"
PKG4="openjdk-11-jdk"
PKG5="maven"
  
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y PKG1
sudo apt install -y PKG2
sudo apt install -y PKG3
sudo apt install -y PKG4
sudo apt install -y PKG5

Instead of declaring 5 variables you hold the values in a array and loop through the values and apply the same processing shown below.
  
#!/bin/bash
PKGS = ("net-tools", "vim", "tree", "openjdk-11-jdk", "maven")
  
I=0
while [ I -lt 5 ]
do
  sudo apt install -y $PKGS[I]
done

How to declare/create arrays in shellscript program?
There are multiple ways we can declare arrays in a shellscript program

#1 
ARRAYNAME=(ELEM1 ELEM2 ELEM3)

#2
declare -a ARRAYNAME = -a stands for create the variable as an array
Now the above ARRAY is delcare as empty array, now we can populate values into the array using index
ARRAYNAME[INDEX]=value

#3 we can interactively read the values and can place them in an array
read -a ARRAYNAME
now when we enter multiple values with spaces separated all of those values are stored in the ARRAY

when we declare and store values in the array, those values are stored adjacently (sequentially), so that we can access the values through index.
Index always starts with 0 and ends depending on the number of elements we are storing in the array.
  
How to access the values from the ARRAY variable?
${ARRAYNAME[INDEX]}  

programs:
#1 wap program to read N numbers from user and print in reverse order of input

#!/bin/bash
delare -a NUMBERS
read -p "N:" N
I=0
while [ $I -lt N ]  
do 
  read -p "NUMBER" T
  NUMBERS[$I]=T
  I=$[I+1]
done
  
I=$[N-1]
until [ $I -lt 0 ]
do
  echo ${NUMBERS[I]}
  I=$[I-1]
done
