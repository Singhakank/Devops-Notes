What is a database management system?
database management system is pre-built software application that takes of storing and accessing the data from the permanent storage device of our computer.
  
In the application program we dont have to write the code for storing or accessing the data on the physical storage of our computer, all the complexities in managing and storing the data on underlying storage is abstracted from us by database management system.

So in our programs we need to write the logic for talking to dbms system in order to store or access, thus the application development becomes very easy and fast as well.
