dependency management
how to use the depencencies distributed by the third-party organizations or opensource contributes?
we need to manually manage the dependencies by downloading them from the third-party vendor and add them to the classpath of our application and ship them by packaging as part of our application.
	
But there are many challenges in manually managing the dependencies.
	1. The bandwidth consumption in downloading the dependencies by all the members of the team is very high
	2. all the members of team are not aware of which dependencies and versions of them are required for building/packaging or running the application
	3. identifying those dependencies from third-party vendors and downloading them takes lot of time
	4. authenticity of the libraries are not guaranteed
	5. there is no control of usage of thrid-party libraries as everyone in the team are allowed to directly download and use them, we landup in such a way different members of the team will use different libraries or versions of them which will result in failure of the application
	6. unknowingly developers might download licensed versions of the depenencies due to which the organization might land into legal or complaince issues.
		
To overcome the above problems, the maven has introduced dependency management.
#1 repositories
#2 dependency declaration
#3 dependency scope

#1 repositories
There are 3 types of repositories supported by the maven
	1. maven central repository
	2. remote repository
	3. local maven repository
