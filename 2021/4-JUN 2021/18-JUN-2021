package managers
How does linux operating system distributes the software packages?
====================================================================
through software repositories

every distro has their own repository to distribute their software packages, in addition an enterprise also can host their own software packages within their repositories.
  broadly we have 2 types of repositories
    1. distro managed
    2. enterprises
    
in each repository there are 4 categories of softwares distributed 
  1. Main        = canonical softwares / free and open source
  2. Universe    = community developed and destributed open source
  3. Restricted  = device driver softwares of the specific hardware
  4. Multiverse  = software distributed under lincensing and legal conditions
  
looks like browsing, downloading and installing these software packages are tedious job so we need package management tools 
ubuntu has provided apt package manager tool that takes care of browing, download and installing the software from an repository.
  
How does apt tool knows the details of the software repositories?
===================================================================
all the repositories information are being stored in /etc/apt/sources.list or as a .list file under /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. apt tool will look into sources.list file to identify the software package repositories to browse, download and install the software.
  
How does the file looks like?
=====================================
deb repositoryUrl focal Main Universe

How to add our own repository into the sources.list?
There are 2 ways are there
  1. manually add an entry into /etc/apt/sources.list or create a file with .list extension that holds repository information and place it under /etc/apt/sources.list.d
  2. use shell utility apt-add-repository
  
every repository has public signing key will be there first we need to download the signing key add the to apt-key 
1. wget keyurl
2. sudo apt-key add keyfilename

now make an entry into /etc/apt/sources.list manually
deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu focal nginx

or we can use apt-add-repository command as shown below
sudo apt-add-repository repositoryUrl

apt stands for advanced packaging tool help us in browsing, downloading and installing the software.

apt update = refreshing the cache (this rebuilds the index of the repository)
apt install packageName
apt upgrade = upgrade all the older versions of the packages to the latest
apt search packageName = search for the packages
apt remove packageName = just uninstall but doesnt cleanup the files of the software
apt purge packageName = uninstall the software and remove files related to that software
apt list --upgradable = give me list of software packages installed on the machine which are available for upgrade.
