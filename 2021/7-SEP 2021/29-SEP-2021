How to host a static website using httpd apache2 server?

#1 we need a server machine. 
  if it is a virtual machine, we need to configure networking mode as NAT + Port Forwarding

#2. Install apache2 server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2

during the installation of the apache2 it will be registered as systemd service automatically.
The default location the apache2 server will be installed on ubuntu
/etc/apache2
|-sites-available
|-sites-enabled
|-conf

#3. copy the static website root into server machine
The standard directory we place the webroot of the application is /var/www.
/var/www
|-ninestars
|-groovin

both the projects are delivered by developers through git repository, so we need to clone both the repositories. 
    git clone -b master gitRepoUrl
    
#4. change the permission of the website root and child directory files to 755
#5. create virtual host configuration file under /etc/apache2/sites-available to map the domainname of the server to the DocumentRoot directory of the website.
as we have 2 domains name we need to write 2 virtual host configuration files
/etc/apache2/sites-available
|-ninestars.conf
|-groovin.conf

http://ninestars/index.html

ninestars.conf
---------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName ninestar
  DocumentRoot /var/www/ninestars
</VirtualHost>
    
    
groovin.conf
------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName groovin
  DocumentRoot /var/www/groovin
</VirtualHost>

#6. we need to enable both the virtual hosts configurations
sudo a2ensite ninestar
sudo a2ensite groovin

#7 sudo systemctl reload apache2
